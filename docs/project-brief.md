## Project Concept

### What are you building?
<!-- Describe your project in 2-3 sentences -->

For this final Advanced Web Design Project, I am creating a web template for a creative design portfolio. This will serve as a foundation for creators to display their work in a tidy and interactive way. 

### Who is it for?
<!-- Define your target audience -->

The target audience for this project is mainly young creators between the ages of 18 through 27 years old. Especifically those who appreciate visual web pages with fun elements while still mantaining a professional appearance and overall cohesive aesthetic.

### Why does it matter?
<!-- Explain the purpose and value of your project -->

Having a creative portfolio is crucial to all designers, illustrators, photographers, and overall creators. The web medium is becoming more and more used with the raise of digital media, which is why having a website is a great idea when it comes to showcasing your work. Having a template with a clear structure to follow is very useful for those who are not experienced in the coding world but still want a nice outcome.

## Design Direction

### Visual Style
<!-- Describe your aesthetic approach -->

Aesthetically, I would like for the portfolio to be minimalistic in essence but to include elements that disrupt the tidyness a little. I will include illustrated elements and layouts that catch the attention of the user. 

### Color Palette
<!-- List your main colors -->

### Typography
<!-- What fonts/typeface approach will you use? -->

### Inspiration/References
<!-- List 2-3 websites or designs that inspire your approach -->
